</head>
<body>
<h2>Java 3D Concepts</h2>
<p>The Java 3D API specification serves to define objects, methods, and
their actions precisely. Describing how to use an API belongs in a
tutorial or programmer's
reference manual, and is well beyond the scope of this specification.
However, a short introduction to the main concepts in Java 3D will
provide the context for understanding the detailed, but isolated,
specification found in the class and method descriptions. We introduce
some of the key Java 3D concepts and illustrate them with some simple
program fragments.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>Basic Scene Graph Concepts</h2>
<p>A scene graph is a "tree" structure that contains data arranged in a
hierarchical manner. The scene graph consists of parent nodes, child
nodes, and data objects. The parent nodes, called Group nodes, organize
and, in some cases, control how Java 3D interprets their descendants.
Group nodes serve as the glue that holds a scene graph together. Child
nodes can be either Group nodes or Leaf nodes. Leaf nodes have no
children. They encode the core semantic elements of a scene graph- for
example, what to draw (geometry), what to play (audio), how to
illuminate objects (lights), or what code to execute (behaviors). Leaf
nodes refer to data objects, called NodeComponent objects.
NodeComponent objects are not scene graph nodes, but they contain the
data that Leaf nodes require, such as the geometry to draw or the sound
sample to play.
</p>
<p>A Java 3D application builds and manipulates a scene graph by
constructing Java 3D objects and then later modifying those objects by
using their methods. A Java 3D program first constructs a scene graph,
then, once built, hands that scene graph to Java 3D for processing.
</p>
<p>The structure of a scene graph determines the relationships among
the
objects in the graph and determines which objects a programmer can
manipulate as a single entity. Group nodes provide a single point for
handling or manipulating all the nodes beneath it. A programmer can
tune a scene graph appropriately by thinking about what manipulations
an application will need to perform. He or she can make a particular
manipulation easy or difficult by grouping or regrouping nodes in
various ways.
</p>

<h3>Constructing a Simple Scene
Graph</h3>
<p>The following code constructs a simple scene graph consisting of a
group node and two leaf
nodes.<br>

<hr>
<p>It first constructs one leaf node, the first of two Shape3D
nodes, using a constructor that takes both a Geometry and an Appearance
NodeComponent object. It then constructs the second Shape3D node, with
only a Geometry object. Next, since the second Shape3D node was created
without an Appearance object, it supplies the missing Appearance object
using the Shape3D node's <code>setAppearance</code> method. At this
point both leaf nodes have been fully constructed. The code next
constructs a group node to hold the two leaf nodes. It
uses the Group node's <code>addChild</code> method to add the two leaf
nodes as children to the group node, finishing the construction of the
scene graph. <a href="#Figure_1">Figure
1</a>
shows the constructed scene graph, all the nodes, the node component
objects, and the variables used in constructing the scene graph.

<h3>A Place For Scene Graphs</h3>
Once a scene graph has been constructed, the
question becomes what to do with it? Java 3D cannot start rendering a
scene graph until a program "gives" it the scene graph. The program
does this by inserting the scene graph into the virtual universe.
<p>Java 3D places restrictions on how a program can insert a scene
graph
into a universe.
</p>
<p>A Java 3D environment consists of two superstructure objects,
VirtualUniverse and Locale, and one or more graphs, rooted by a special
BranchGroup node. <a href="#Figure_2">Figure 2</a> shows these objects
in context with other scene graph objects.
</p>
<p>The VirtualUniverse object defines a universe. A universe allows a
Java
3D program to create a separate and distinct arena for defining objects
and their relationships to one another. Typically, Java 3D programs
have only one VirtualUniverse object. Programs that have more than one
VirtualUniverse may share NodeComponent objects but not scene graph
node objects.
</p>
<p>The Locale object specifies a fixed position within the universe.
That
fixed position defines an origin for all scene graph nodes beneath it.
The Locale object allows a programmer to specify that origin very
precisely and with very high dynamic range. A Locale can accurately
specify a location anywhere in the known physical universe and at the
precision of Plank's distance. Typically, Java 3D programs have only
one Locale object with a default origin of (0, 0, 0). Programs that
have more than one Locale object will set the location of the
individual Locale objects so that they provide an appropriate local
origin for the nodes beneath them. For example, to model the Mars
landing, a programmer might create one Locale object with an origin at
Cape Canaveral and another with an origin located at the landing site
on Mars.

</p>
<ul>
  <font size="-1"><b><i>Figure 2</i> &#8211; Content Branch, View Branch, and
Superstructure</b></font>
</ul>
<p>
The BranchGroup node serves as the root of a <em>branch graph</em>.
Collectively, the BranchGroup node and all of its children form the
branch graph. The two kinds of branch graphs are called content
branches and view branches. A <em>content branch</em> contains only
content-related leaf nodes, while a <em>view branch</em>
contains a ViewPlatform leaf node and may contain other content-related
leaf nodes. Typically, a universe contains more than one branch
graph-one view branch, and any number of content branches.
</p>
<p>Besides serving as the root of a branch graph, the BranchGroup node
has
two special properties: It alone may be inserted into a Locale object,
and it may be compiled. Java 3D treats uncompiled and compiled branch
graphs identically, though compiled branch graphs will typically render
more efficiently.
</p>
<p>We could not insert the scene graph created by our simple example (<a
 href="#Listing_1">Listing
1</a>) into a Locale because it does not have a BranchGoup node for
its root. <a href="#Listing_2">Listing 2</a>
shows a modified version of our first code example that creates a
simple content branch graph and the minimum of superstructure objects.
Of special note, Locales do not have children, and they are not part of
the scene graph. The method for inserting a branch graph is <code>addBranchGraph</code>,
whereas <code>addChild</code> is the method for adding children to all
group nodes.</p>

<h3>SimpleUniverse Utility</h3>
Most Java 3D programs build an identical set of superstructure and view
branch objects, so the Java 3D utility packages provide a <code>universe</code>
package for constructing and manipulating the objects in a view branch.
The classes in the <code>universe</code> package provide a quick means
for building a single view (single window) application. <a
 href="#Listing_3">Listing 3</a>
shows a code fragment for using the SimpleUniverse class. Note that the
SimpleUniverse constructor takes a Canvas3D as an argument, in this
case referred to by the variable <code>myCanvas</code>.

<h3>Processing a Scene Graph</h3>
When given a scene graph, Java 3D processes that scene graph as
efficiently as possible. How a Java 3D implementation processes a scene
graph can vary, as long as the implementation conforms to the semantics
of the API. In general, a Java 3D implementation will render all
visible objects, play all enabled sounds, execute all triggered
behaviors, process any identified input devices, and check for and
generate appropriate collision events.
<p>The order that a particular Java 3D implementation renders objects
onto
the display is carefully not defined. One implementation might render
the first Shape3D object and then the second. Another might first
render the second Shape3D node before it renders the first one. Yet
another implementation may render both Shape3D nodes in parallel.
</p>

<h2>Features of Java 3D</h2>
Java 3D allows a programmer to specify a broad range of information. It
allows control over the shape of objects, their color, and
transparency. It allows control over background effects, lighting, and
environmental effects such as fog. It allows control over the placement
of all objects (even nonvisible objects such as lights and behaviors)
in the scene graph and over their orientation and scale. It allows
control over how those objects move, rotate, stretch, shrink, or morph
over time. It allows control over what code should execute, what sounds
should play, and how they should sound and change over time.
<p>Java 3D provides different techniques for controlling the effect of
various features. Some techniques act fairly locally, such as getting
the color of a vertex. Other techniques have broader influence, such as
changing the color or appearance of an entire object. Still other
techniques apply to a broad number of objects. In the first two cases,
the programmer can modify a particular object or an object associated
with the affected object. In the latter case, Java 3D provides a means
for specifying more than one object spatially.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Bounds</h3>
Bounds objects allow a programmer to define a volume in space. There
are three ways to specify this volume: as a box, a sphere, or a set of
planes enclosing a space.
<p>Bounds objects specify a volume in which particular operations
apply.
Environmental effects such as lighting, fog, alternate appearance, and
model clipping planes use bounds objects to specify their region of
influence. Any object that falls within the space defined by the bounds
object has the particular environmental effect applied. The proper use
of bounds objects can ensure that these environmental effects are
applied only to those objects in a particular volume, such as a light
applying only to the objects within a single room.
</p>
<p>Bounds objects are also used to specify a region of action.
Behaviors
and sounds execute or play only if they are close enough to the viewer.
The use of behavior and sound bounds objects allows Java 3D to cull
away those behaviors and sounds that are too far away to affect the
viewer (listener). By using bounds properly, a programmer can ensure
that only the relevant behaviors and sounds execute or play.
</p>
<p>Finally, bounds objects are used to specify a region of application
for
per-view operations such as background, clip, and soundscape selection.
For example, the background node whose region of application is closest
to the viewer is selected for a given view.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Nodes</h3>
All scene graph nodes have an implicit location in space of (0, 0, 0).
For objects that exist in space, this implicit location provides a
local coordinate system for that object, a fixed reference point. Even
abstract objects that may not seem to have a well-defined location,
such as behaviors and ambient lights, have this implicit location. An
object's location provides an origin for its local coordinate system
and, just as importantly, an origin for any bounding volume information
associated with that object.
<h3>Live and/or Compiled</h3>
All scene graph objects, including nodes and node component objects,
are either part of an active universe or not. An object is said to be <em>live</em>
if it is part of an active universe. Additionally, branch graphs are
either <em>compiled</em>
or not. When a node is either live or compiled, Java 3D enforces access
restrictions to nodes and node component objects. Java 3D allows only
those operations that are enabled by the program before a node or node
component becomes live or is compiled. It is best to set capabilities
when you build your content. <a href="#Listing_4">Listing 4</a> shows
an example where we create a TransformGroup node and
enable it for writing.
<p><font size="-1"><b><i><a name="Listing_4"></a>Listing 4</i> &#8211;
Capabilities Example
</b></font></p>
<hr>
<pre>TransformGroup myTrans = new TransformGroup();<br>myTrans.setCapability(Transform.ALLOW_TRANSFORM_WRITE);<br></pre>
<hr>
<p>By setting the capability to write the transform, Java 3D will allow
the following code to execute:
</p>
<pre>myTrans.setTransform3D(myT3D);<br></pre>
<p>It is important to ensure that all needed capabilities are set and
that
unnecessary capabilities are not set. The process of compiling a branch
graph examines the capability bits and uses that information to reduce
the amount of computation needed to run a program.
